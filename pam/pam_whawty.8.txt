SYNOPSIS
--------

....
pam_whawty.so
  [ debug ]

  [ use_first_pass ]
  [ not_set_pass ]
  [ sock=</path/to/whawty/socket> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*pam_whawty* is a pam module which uses whawty.auth as authentication backend.
In order for *pam_whawty* to work the whawty.auth app must be running on the
machine. Since whawty.auth uses the same protocol as saslauthd *pam_whawty* might
as well be used to authenticate against saslauthd.


OPTIONS
-------

The following options can be passed to the *pam_whawty* module:

*debug*::
   This turns on additional logging using *syslog*(3).

*try_first_pass*::
   This instructs *pam_whawty* to try the password of a previous module from the
   stack. Only if there is no password found it will ask the user for a password.

*use_first_pass*::
   This is similar to *try_first_pass* but if no password is found on the stack
   the module fails. *pam_whawty* will not try to get the password from the user.

*not_set_pass*::
   By default *pam_whawty* pushes a fetched password onto the stack for other
   modules to be used. If this option is set the password is not pushed onto the
   stack.

*sock=</path/to/whawty/socket>*::
   This option can be used to configure the path to the whawty.auth unix socket.
   By default */var/run/whawty/auth.sock* is used.

*timeout=<seconds>*::
   In case the authentication daemon does not respond to authentication requests
   by default *pam_whawty* will report an authentication failure after 3 seconds.
   This option makes this period configurable.


MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
---------------------

Only module type *auth* is provided however it is not possible to change passwords
using this module.
