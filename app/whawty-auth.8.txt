SYNOPSIS
--------

whawty-auth [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*whawty-auth* implements everything which is needed to run a whawty auth service.
This tool can be used to initialize and manage whawty auth stores. When used as a
daemon it can be used to offer a saslauthd compatible authentication service and
or a small web interface to manage users and passwords. Together with *pam_whawty*
this can also be used with PAM.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------

The following options can be passed to *whawty-auth*:

*-c | --conf </path/to/config.json>*::
    This sets the path to main configuration file. By default *whawty-auth* uses
    the file */etc/whawty-auth/default.json*. This may also be configured using
    the environment variable: WHAWTY_AUTH_CONFIG. If both the environment variable
    and the command line option are supplied the latter is used.

*--do-check[=(true|false)]*::
    Run basic consistency check on the whawty store on startup. By default checks
    are enabled. This can also be configured using the environment variable:
    WHAWTY_AUTH_DO_CHECK. If both the environment variable and the command line
    option are supplied the latter is used.

*-h | --help*::
    Show help text and exit.

*-v | --version*::
    Print version information and exit.
